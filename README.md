# Smoothblow-device-for-PET
## Project description
We imagine a device for smoothing PET bottles, therefore it can be used for 3d print filament.
Before we organized this concept, there were some initial attempts that introduced how this concept came to life. If you would like to read more, you can click the link below.

## Work Flow
1. Adjust the Z-axis extension rod of the machine to match the height of the bottle.

2. Remove the bottle cap, then use a silicone stopper of the appropriate size (with an air nozzle installed on top), and place the bottle into the machine, aligning it with the air inlet. Pull down the lever to connect the air inlet of the machine with the nozzle, then inject air into the bottle.

3. Lift the lever to suspend the bottle, press the button to start the heating tube, and simultaneously rotate the bottle quickly to ensure even heating.

4. Once the surface of the bottle becomes smooth, press the stop button to remove the bottle.

# MakerFaire

At MakerFaire, we showcased our design posters and models to the public and engaged in discussions with some visitors. During these interactions, we repeatedly explained the entire design process, which helped us gain a deeper understanding of our own workflow. At the same time, through visitors’ questions and feedback, we identified some potential issues—for example, whether the model is suitable for various sizes of plastic bottles, and how to more clearly indicate that the design accommodates most bottle sizes. Many visitors were initially unfamiliar with the process of recycling PET plastic bottles for 3D printing. After we introduced the process to them, many expressed that it is a very environmentally friendly technology and even asked whether it would be implemented on a larger scale in the future. This suggests that the process has great potential for development.

我们在MakerFaire中向公众展示了我们的设计海报与设计模型，并且与一些参观者进行交流。在与他们交流的过程中，我们不断重复整个设计过程，这使得我们更深刻的理解了自己的设计流程。同时，在与参观者的交流提问中，我们挖掘到了一些可能存在的问题，比如这个模型的设计是否适用于各种尺寸的塑料瓶，能否更加明确的方式表示这个设计是适配大多数瓶子的尺寸的。很多参观者在事先是并不了解pet塑料瓶回收而被重新3D打印这个流程的，我们向他们介绍，很多参观者表示这是十分环保的一个技术，还询问我们之后是否会落地，由此看来这个流程是很有发展前景的。
